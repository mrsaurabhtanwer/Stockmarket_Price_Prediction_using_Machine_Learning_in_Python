## 📌 Project Overview

Key tasks performed in this project:

- Downloading historical stock data using `yfinance`
- Cleaning and preparing time series data
- Creating technical indicators and features
- Training machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM)
- Visualizing model predictions against actual prices

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- Python 3.8 or newer  
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
- Internet connection for data fetching

---

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mrsaurabhtanwer/Stockmarket_Price_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_in_Python.git
cd Stockmarket_Price_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_in_Python

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> ⚠️ If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:

```bash
pip install yfinance numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn keras tensorflow
```

---

## 🧩 Usage

1. Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Stockmarket_Price_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_in_Python.ipynb
```

2. Follow the step-by-step process:

   * Data download and preprocessing
   * Feature engineering
   * Model training and evaluation
   * Plotting predictions

3. Customize inputs like the ticker symbol (`'AAPL'`, `'GOOG'`, etc.), date ranges, and model hyperparameters.

## 🧠 Methodology

The notebook implements a standard ML pipeline:

* **Data Collection** – using Yahoo Finance API
* **Exploratory Data Analysis** – summary statistics, trends
* **Feature Engineering** – technical indicators (e.g., moving averages)
* **Model Training** – regression and deep learning models
* **Evaluation** – using RMSE, MAE
* **Visualization** – comparing predicted and actual stock prices

---

## 📊 Results & Evaluation

The project demonstrates and compares multiple models. Key highlights:

* Model performance is assessed using RMSE and MAE
* LSTM provides better long-term sequence forecasting
* Visualization helps compare real vs. predicted prices over time

---

## 📦 Dependencies

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `yfinance`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `tensorflow`, `keras`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn yfinance matplotlib seaborn tensorflow keras
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can modify these variables in the notebook:

| Parameter    | Description               | Example        |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| `ticker`     | Stock ticker symbol       | `"AAPL"`       |
| `start_date` | Start of data range       | `"2015-01-01"` |
| `end_date`   | End of data range         | `"2025-06-10"` |
| `epochs`     | Number of training epochs | `100`          |

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

* **Import Errors**: Ensure all libraries are installed.
* **Data Errors**: Check ticker symbol and date format.
* **Model Failures**: Try adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, epochs).
